# Welcome to My First Scraper
***

## Task
The task is to create a my first scraper file in python.

## Description
My first scraper used a programming language like Python it relied on external libraries or frameworks to help with tasks like making HTTP requests, parsing HTML content, and storing data.
The specifics of my scraper depended on the website I was  targeting which was git hub and the type of data I was trying to extract.
 For example, I built a scraper to extract information from a git hub site, articles from the site.
In general, a scraper will use code to send HTTP requests to the target website,
 parse the HTML content of the website, extract the desired data, and store it in a format that is useful for further analysis or manipulation.

## Installation
There was no Installation.

## Usage
The usage of web scraping files depends on the specific needs of the user. For example, 
web scraping can be used to extract data for research or analysis purposes, to collect product information 
for e-commerce sites, to monitor social media sentiment, to extract news articles, and many other applications.
To use a web scraping file, you need to have the appropriate programming environment set up on your computer, 
including any necessary libraries or dependencies. 
Once the environment is set up, you can run the web scraping file by executing the script in the command line or terminal.
